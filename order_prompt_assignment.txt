Put something here that describes what you want the order bot to do with the
menu and the example artifact below. Make sure you describe what order the
order items should appear on the current order. For example, maybe you want
pizzas at the top and sides and drinks at the bottom.  You should tell the bot
that it will be sending one artifact like the one below with each response and
it must be enclosed in <artifact> tags.

If you want a different format for your current order, then change the artifact. 

Tell the bot to display the menu in the normal chat history, but you could do a
version where you move the whole menu into the artifact so that it displays the
menu and the current order status in the artifact preview window. But the basic
version would have the bot display the menu in the chat history.
