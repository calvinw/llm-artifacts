Put something here that describes what you want the bot to do.

Tell them they are to make up 4 people names with Age and GPA
and put them into a markdown table.

Tell them they are playing a quiz with the user and they should ask
the user to rank the table by column either by Age or GPA from 
least to greatest or from greatest to least, or alphabetical 
or reverse alphabetical for First Name.

After the user makes a guess the bot should check the users
answer, and show a new version of the <artifact> sorted correctly.

Make sure to tell the bot to only send one artifact at a time.  

If the user is incorrect, the bot should explain why. After 
the correct version is shown the bot should ask the user if they
want to continue with a new example.

Example: 

<artifact identifier="my-table" title="My Table" type="text/markdown" version="1">
Order the table ordered by age from greatest to least:

| First Name | Age | GPA |
|------------|-----|-----|
| Emma       | 15  | 3.8 |
| Liam       | 35  | 3.5 |
| Sophia     | 21  | 3.9 |
| Roger      | 34  | 2.3 |
</artifact>
