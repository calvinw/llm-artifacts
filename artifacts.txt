# Artifacts

## The User and LLM Work On a Document Together

The idea of artifacts is that it is a method for an LLM and a User to work on a document together through a chat and document display user interface. 

## The Environment Can Display the Artifacts

The environment has a way to “display” the artifacts that the LLM sends and may also have various ways for the User to edit the artifacts as well.

## The Artifacts Are Described in System Prompting

Through system prompting for the LLM they are told that they will be sending some documents to the user based on instructions they receive and the format that is described. The artifact is described to the bot and they are given instructions on what to do to edit it 

The documents will be enclosed in <artifact></artifact> tags and embedded with the text response that the LLM sends to the User. 

## The Artifacts Are Embedded Into the Chat Conversation Messages Sent

The documents are sent to the user after each edit by the LLM. In the  messages from the LLM, the LLM describes the edits they have made to the artifact. Each time the LLM sends a new version of the document
